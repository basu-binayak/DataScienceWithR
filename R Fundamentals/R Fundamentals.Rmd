This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# R Fundamentals

## 🧑‍🔬 Introduction to R Programming

**R** is a powerful, open-source programming language and environment specifically designed for **data analysis, statistics, and visualization**.

Developed in the early 1990s by statisticians Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman, R has since grown into one of the most popular languages in **data science, machine learning, and academic research**.

### 📦 Why Learn R for Data Science?

R is tailor-made for data manipulation and statistical modeling. It comes packed with a massive ecosystem of **packages** (like `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `caret`, and `shiny`) that make data wrangling, visualization, and machine learning intuitive and effective.

### 🚀 What Makes R Special?

| Feature | Why It Matters in Data Science |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 🧮 Built for Statistics | Includes built-in support for statistical tests, models. |
| 📊 Elegant Visualizations | `ggplot2` and `plotly` help build publication-ready charts. |
| 🧰 Vast Package Ecosystem | Thousands of CRAN packages for every data task imaginable. |
| 📈 Great for Reporting | Use RMarkdown to create dynamic reports and dashboards. |
| 👨‍🏫 Widely Used in Academia | Preferred tool for research and data-driven insights. |

### 🧪 What Can You Do with R?

-   Clean and explore messy datasets (`tidyverse`)
-   Create beautiful data visualizations (`ggplot2`)
-   Build machine learning models (`caret`, `mlr`)
-   Generate dynamic reports (`RMarkdown`)
-   Create interactive web apps (`shiny`)

### 💻 Your First R Code

Here's a taste of R:

```{r}

# Assign a variable
name <- "R Language"

# Create a numeric vector
scores <- c(85, 90, 88, 95)

# Calculate the mean
mean_score <- mean(scores)

# Print the result
print(paste("Average score is", mean_score))

```

### 🛠️ R in Action

R is used by:

-   **Statisticians** for rigorous analysis
-   **Data scientists** for modeling and ML
-   **Researchers** for publication-quality graphics
-   **Businesses** for reporting and dashboards

### 📌 TL;DR

> R is a language built *by statisticians, for statisticians*—but it's now embraced across the entire data science pipeline. Whether you’re visualizing data, modeling trends, or writing reproducible reports, **R makes data analysis elegant and powerful**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔍 Deep Dive: Types of Variables in R

In R, variables are dynamically typed, meaning you don’t need to declare a variable’s type—it’s inferred from the value you assign. But **understanding the types of variables (also called data types or object types)** is critical for proper data manipulation and analysis.

### 🧱 1. **Numeric (Double & Integer)**

**Used when you're working with numbers—like prices, scores, measurements.**

-   **Numeric (double):** Default type for decimal or whole numbers.
-   **Integer:** Whole numbers explicitly defined with an `L`.

```{r}
x <- 45.67      # numeric (double)
y <- 23L        # integer (the L tells R it's an integer)

print(x)
print(typeof(y))

```

📌 *Use case:* Height of individuals (`170.5` cm), Number of sales (`100L`).

### 🔤 2. **Character (String)**

**Textual data—names, categories, IDs.**

```{r}
name <- "Binayak"
city <- "Paris"

print(paste(name, "lives in", city))

```

📌 *Use case:* Customer names, product categories, file paths.

### ✅ 3. **Logical (Boolean)**

**Only two values: `TRUE` or `FALSE`.** Used in comparisons and filtering.

```{r}
is_passed <- TRUE

age <- 65L
is_senior <- age > 60  # returns a logical value

print(is_senior)

```

📌 *Use case:* Checking if a value meets a condition (e.g., is salary \> 50K?).

### 📅 4. **Date and Time**

**Special types to handle calendar dates and timestamps.**

```{r}
today <- Sys.Date()
now <- Sys.time()

print(today)
print(now)

```

📌 *Use case:* Transaction dates, login timestamps, time series analysis.

### 🧩 5. **Factor (Categorical Variable)**

**Used for categorical data with fixed possible values.**

```{r}
gender <- factor(c("Male", "Female", "Male"))
levels(gender)

```

📌 *Use case:* Gender, Blood Type, Education Level (ordinal or nominal).

### 📦 6. **Complex**

**Rarely used. For complex numbers with real + imaginary parts.**

```{r}
z <- 3 + 4i
```

📌 *Use case:* Advanced mathematical/statistical modeling.

### ⚙️ 7. **Raw**

**Stores bytes. Used in low-level programming, file handling.**

```{r}

raw_var <- charToRaw("Hello")
print(raw_var)

```

📌 *Use case:* Binary data, encryption, file I/O.

### 🧪 Check Variable Types

Use these functions to check or convert types:

```{r}
x <- 45.67
class(x)      # Returns "numeric", "character", etc.
typeof(x)     # More technical/internal type
is.numeric(x) # Checks if x is numeric
as.character(x) # Converts to character

```

### 🧠 Tip:

R variables can change types based on operations:

```{r}
a <- "5"          # character
b <- as.numeric(a)  # now numeric
```

### 📌 Summary Table:

| Type      | Example Value    | Function       | Use Case              |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| Numeric   | `5.5`, `23`      | `is.numeric`   | Calculations, metrics |
| Integer   | `23L`            | `is.integer`   | Discrete counts       |
| Character | `"Apple"`        | `is.character` | Names, categories     |
| Logical   | `TRUE`, `FALSE`  | `is.logical`   | Conditions, filters   |
| Factor    | `factor("Low")`  | `is.factor`    | Categorical encoding  |
| Date      | `Sys.Date()`     | `is.Date`      | Timestamps, dates     |
| Complex   | `2 + 3i`         | `is.complex`   | Math, simulations     |
| Raw       | `charToRaw("A")` | `is.raw`       | Bytes, files          |
