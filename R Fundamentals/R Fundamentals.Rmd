This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# R Fundamentals

## 🧑‍🔬 Introduction to R Programming

**R** is a powerful, open-source programming language and environment specifically designed for **data analysis, statistics, and visualization**.

Developed in the early 1990s by statisticians Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman, R has since grown into one of the most popular languages in **data science, machine learning, and academic research**.

### 📦 Why Learn R for Data Science?

R is tailor-made for data manipulation and statistical modeling. It comes packed with a massive ecosystem of **packages** (like `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `caret`, and `shiny`) that make data wrangling, visualization, and machine learning intuitive and effective.

### 🚀 What Makes R Special?

| Feature | Why It Matters in Data Science |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 🧮 Built for Statistics | Includes built-in support for statistical tests, models. |
| 📊 Elegant Visualizations | `ggplot2` and `plotly` help build publication-ready charts. |
| 🧰 Vast Package Ecosystem | Thousands of CRAN packages for every data task imaginable. |
| 📈 Great for Reporting | Use RMarkdown to create dynamic reports and dashboards. |
| 👨‍🏫 Widely Used in Academia | Preferred tool for research and data-driven insights. |

### 🧪 What Can You Do with R?

-   Clean and explore messy datasets (`tidyverse`)
-   Create beautiful data visualizations (`ggplot2`)
-   Build machine learning models (`caret`, `mlr`)
-   Generate dynamic reports (`RMarkdown`)
-   Create interactive web apps (`shiny`)

### 💻 Your First R Code

Here's a taste of R:

```{r}

# Assign a variable
name <- "R Language"

# Create a numeric vector
scores <- c(85, 90, 88, 95)

# Calculate the mean
mean_score <- mean(scores)

# Print the result
print(paste("Average score is", mean_score))

```

### 🛠️ R in Action

R is used by:

-   **Statisticians** for rigorous analysis
-   **Data scientists** for modeling and ML
-   **Researchers** for publication-quality graphics
-   **Businesses** for reporting and dashboards

### 📌 TL;DR

> R is a language built *by statisticians, for statisticians*—but it's now embraced across the entire data science pipeline. Whether you’re visualizing data, modeling trends, or writing reproducible reports, **R makes data analysis elegant and powerful**.
